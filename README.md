# Financial_Dashboard
I recently completed my assignment on an internship, which is related to the financial dashboard. It presents a clear, data-driven view of financial performance over the years 2020–2022. It includes key financial metrics, trend analysis, and comparisons to support decision-making.
What I discovered is that:

✅ Strong Revenue Growth: Revenue is increasing consistently.
⚠️ High Expenses: COGS and operating expenses are major cost factors.
📈 Profitability is Improving: Net Income and EPS show upward trends.
🔍 Focus on Cost Optimization: Reducing expenses can further boost profit margins.
💰 Investment Potential: Increasing EPS makes the company a good investment option.
